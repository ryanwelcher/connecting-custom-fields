## Overview

Welcome to the companion repository for the **"Connecting Custom Fields from Meta Boxes to Blocks and Beyond"** workshop at WordCamp Lisboa 2025!

In this hands-on session, we’ll bridge the gap between traditional WordPress meta boxes and modern block-based development. Whether you’re migrating legacy projects or building editorial tools from scratch, you’ll gain practical skills for working with custom fields in the block editor.

## 🔍 What You'll Learn

- ✅ Reading and writing custom meta using WordPress Core APIs.
- 🛠️ Building alternative user interfaces for managing meta fields.
- 🔌 Integrating popular frameworks like **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)**, **Secure Custom Fields (SCF)**, and **Pods**
- 🔗 Connecting Core Gutenberg blocks to custom meta fields for a seamless editorial experience
- 🧩 Using **CustomBlock Bindings** to dynamically bind native blocks to meta data

## 🧰 Prerequisites
